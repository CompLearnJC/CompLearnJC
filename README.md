# 🧠 Compositional Learning Journal Club

Welcome to the **Compositional Learning Journal Club**!\
We are a research-focused community dedicated to exploring compositional problems in machine learning.

## ❓ What Are Compositional Problems?

Compositional problems in machine learning involve understanding how complex tasks or concepts can be broken down into simpler, more fundamental components. A key challenge is designing models that can learn to effectively combine these components to solve intricate problems. This approach is crucial for tasks like:

- **🗣️ Natural Language Understanding**: Interpreting and generating language by combining words and phrases in meaningful ways.
- **👁️ Vision and Perception**: Recognizing and assembling different elements of a scene, such as objects and their relationships.
- **🧩 Reasoning and Planning**: Decomposing complex decisions into a series of logical steps or actions.

In essence, compositional learning seeks to enable AI systems to think in a modular and structured way, much like how humans break down and understand complex concepts.
